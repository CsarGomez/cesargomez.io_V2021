npm global install return and access error (EACCES error) asking for sudo command in order to install global packages, this happens due to the fact that permissions has been wrong setup. 

this article applies for macOS ans ZSH users.

### npm default directory

The default directory for npm is */usr/local/* you can check in your terminal

```shell:Hyper
  npm config get prefix
  # it should return /usr/local
```

### node_modules permissions check

To check the permissions for node_modules use the following command:

```shell:Hyper
  ls -la /usr/local/lib/node_modules
  # you should get something like this:

  # total 0
  # drwxr-xr-x   4 root  128 ...
  # drwxr-xr-x   4 root  128 ...
  # drwxr-xr-x   7 root  128 ... corepack
  # drwxr-xr-x  13 root  128 ... npm
```

this means that the only user that can read and write under the folder is *root* that's why you need to use the *sudo* command.

But you can install npm packages without sudo command by changing the default directory to a different one

### Change npm directory

Before change the current directory we need to create a new one under the home directory:

go to your home directory and to double check in which directory you are, use the command

```shell:Hyper
  pwd
  # return: /Users/cesargomez (home directory)
```

create a new folder insode the home directory and you can named as you preffer, i will named as **npm-global**

```shell:Hyper
  mkdir npm-global
```

move to the new npm-global folder by using

```shell:Hyper
  cd npm-global
```

setup the new directory to be the npm directory with the following command:

```shell:Hyper
  npm config set prefix /Users/user/new_folder

  # example: npm config set prefix /User/cesargomez/npm-global
```

now we need to update the system $PATH in this case the zsh Path, so from you home directory open your zsh preferences with VScode 

```shell:Hyper
  code ~/.zshrc
```
 and modifie the like that start with **export PATH = ...** with you new path and add */bin:$PATH* at the end like this

```shell:VSCode
  export PATH=/Users/your_user/your_new_directory/bin:$PATH
```

the we need to update the zsh variables by typing:

```shell:Hyper
  source ~/.zshrc
```

this will fix you permissions setup, now you will be able to install npm global packages without having to use the sudo command.
