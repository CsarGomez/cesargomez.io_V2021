## Install Cobalt 2 theme 
first open the *~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/* directory, this is a hidden directory.

> to show hidden directories press shift + cmd + .

to get the <ExternalLink href='https://github.com/wesbos/hyperterm-cobalt2-theme' text='Cobalt2 theme' /> go to the link drag the archive named as cobalt2.zshtheme and drop into the *.oh-my-zsh* folder

open ZSH preferences (i use VSCode for that <ExternalLink href='https://cesargomez.io/blog/install-HyperJs' text='how to here'/>) and change the line:

```shell:ZSH_preferences
  ZSH_THEME='cobalt2'
```

now you need to refresh your ZSH with following command:

```shell:hyper.js
  source ~/.zshrc
```

### install ans setup power fonts

Cobalt2 uses power fonts for prompt, so power fonts need to be installed aand cam be download from <ExternalLink href='https://github.com/powerline/fonts' text='here'/> and installed as you instal regular fonts.

Since i use Hyper i need to setup the power fonts in Hyper.js, so open hyper preferences 

```shell:hyper.js
 code ~/.zshrc
```

and then add the font
