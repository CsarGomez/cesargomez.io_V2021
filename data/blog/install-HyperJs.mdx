## Install

go to the <ExternalLink href='https://hyper.is/' text='Hyper.js'/> website and download the app

## setup

by default Hyper uses <ExternalLink href='https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash' text='bash'/> as a command interpreter, so i will replace bash with <ExternalLink href='https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsh' text='zsh'/>, due to that we will be able to use <ExternalLink href='https://ohmyz.sh/' text='oh-my-zsh'/> which will allow us to pimp our terminal.

## install oh-my-zsh

go to the website and follow the instructions or just install vie curl or wget with the following comands:

```shell:hyper.js_via-curl
  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

```shell:hyper.js_via-wget
  sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

Now since we are using oh-my-zsh it will allow us to use whatever theme that are ablailable in <ExternalLink href='https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes' text='here' /> and you will be able to see a quick preview for each theme.

### setup themes

i like to open Hyper preferences in VSCode, so i will setup this feature first by opening the VScode preferences

```shell:VSCode
  cmd + shift + p
```
once the command prompt line is open hit

```shell:hyper.js
  install code
```

after that you will be able to open Hyper and Zsh preferences in VSCode by typing in your Hyper:

```shell:Hyper
  code ~/.hyper.js
```
```shell:ZSH
  code ~/.zshrc
```

once you open the ZSH preferences you can add the theme you want by replace:

```shell:ZSH_preferences
  ZSH_THEME='theme-you-like'
```
